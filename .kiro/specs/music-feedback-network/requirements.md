# Music Feedback Network - Requirements Document

## Introduction

A minimalist music feedback networking app that enables instant, wordless validation of songs through visual feedback mechanisms. The app focuses on creating a universal, lightweight social platform that can scale while maintaining simplicity and effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with the existing music app to provide real-time feedback on uploaded tracks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Instant Visual Feedback System

**User Story:** As a music listener, I want to give instant feedback on songs without typing words, so that I can quickly express my opinion and see others' reactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user listens to a track THEN the system SHALL display visual feedback options (emoji reactions, swipe gestures, or tap interactions)
2. WHEN a user selects a feedback option THEN the system SHALL immediately record and display the feedback without page refresh
3. WHEN multiple users provide feedback THEN the system SHALL aggregate and display real-time feedback statistics
4. WHEN a user views a track THEN the system SHALL show aggregated feedback from all users in a visually appealing format
5. IF a user has already provided feedback THEN the system SHALL highlight their previous choice and allow them to change it

### Requirement 2: Minimalist Social Discovery

**User Story:** As a music creator, I want to see how people react to my music in real-time, so that I can understand audience preferences and improve my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a creator uploads a track THEN the system SHALL automatically make it available for feedback from the network
2. WHEN users provide feedback THEN the creator SHALL receive real-time notifications of reactions
3. WHEN a track receives feedback THEN the system SHALL display trending tracks based on positive feedback ratios
4. WHEN users browse the feed THEN the system SHALL show tracks with the most recent activity first
5. IF a track reaches certain feedback thresholds THEN the system SHALL promote it to featured sections

### Requirement 3: Universal Integration Platform

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the feedback system to work seamlessly with the existing music app, so that I have a unified experience across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in the main music app THEN the system SHALL display feedback options on all playable tracks
2. WHEN a user uploads music through the existing upload system THEN the track SHALL automatically be available for network feedback
3. WHEN a user searches for music THEN the system SHALL include feedback metrics in search results
4. WHEN a user creates playlists THEN the system SHALL show aggregated feedback for playlist tracks
5. IF the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL sync feedback data across all app sections

### Requirement 4: Lightweight Performance Architecture

**User Story:** As any user, I want the feedback system to load instantly and respond immediately, so that my experience is smooth and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens any page with feedback features THEN the system SHALL load within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user provides feedback THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms
3. WHEN multiple users interact simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent feedback without performance degradation
4. WHEN the app scales to more users THEN the system SHALL maintain performance through efficient database queries
5. IF network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL cache feedback locally and sync when connection improves

### Requirement 5: Scalable Social Features

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the system to support growth from hundreds to millions of users, so that the platform can scale without architectural changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user base grows THEN the system SHALL maintain response times through horizontal scaling
2. WHEN feedback volume increases THEN the system SHALL efficiently aggregate data using optimized database operations
3. WHEN new social features are needed THEN the system SHALL support extensions through modular component architecture
4. WHEN analytics are required THEN the system SHALL provide real-time insights into user engagement patterns
5. IF the system needs maintenance THEN the architecture SHALL support zero-downtime deployments

### Requirement 6: Responsive UI Design Excellence

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the feedback interface to be beautifully designed and perfectly responsive, so that I have an optimal experience whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the app on mobile THEN the system SHALL display touch-optimized feedback controls with proper spacing and sizing
2. WHEN a user rotates their device THEN the system SHALL seamlessly adapt the layout without losing functionality or visual appeal
3. WHEN a user interacts with feedback elements THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and visual feedback with 60fps performance
4. WHEN the app loads on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL use responsive breakpoints to optimize layout for each device category
5. IF a user has accessibility needs THEN the system SHALL support screen readers, keyboard navigation, and high contrast modes

### Requirement 7: Minimalist Visual Design System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be clean, intuitive, and visually stunning, so that I can focus on the music and feedback without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any feedback interface THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes following design system principles
2. WHEN feedback elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL use subtle animations and micro-interactions to enhance user engagement
3. WHEN multiple feedback options are shown THEN the system SHALL use clear visual hierarchy and intuitive iconography
4. WHEN the interface updates with new feedback THEN the system SHALL use smooth transitions that don't disrupt the user's flow
5. IF the user prefers dark or light themes THEN the system SHALL seamlessly adapt all feedback components to match the chosen theme

### Requirement 8: Cross-Device Consistency

**User Story:** As a user who switches between devices, I want the same beautiful and functional experience everywhere, so that I can seamlessly continue my music discovery journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches from mobile to desktop THEN the system SHALL maintain the same interaction patterns with device-appropriate optimizations
2. WHEN touch gestures are used on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent mouse/keyboard interactions on desktop
3. WHEN the app is used on tablets THEN the system SHALL optimize for both portrait and landscape orientations with appropriate layouts
4. WHEN users interact with feedback on different devices THEN the system SHALL sync state and preferences across all platforms
5. IF new devices or screen sizes emerge THEN the system SHALL gracefully adapt through flexible responsive design principles

### Requirement 9: Privacy and User Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want control over my feedback visibility and data, so that I can participate comfortably in the network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides feedback THEN the system SHALL allow anonymous or identified participation based on user preference
2. WHEN a user wants to see their feedback history THEN the system SHALL provide a personal dashboard
3. WHEN a user wants to delete their data THEN the system SHALL remove all associated feedback and activity
4. WHEN users interact THEN the system SHALL respect privacy settings and only show permitted information
